						<h2>UK Property Data Scraper</h2>
						<p>This app scrapes data from the UK property site Zoopla. It allows you to make certain selections such as what city, how many rooms, and your preferred price range. You can then download the results to your downloads folder.<br><br>
						It was built using python and other third party libraries, such as bs4, pandas, requests and tkinter. <br><br>
						See the gif below for more details.</p>

						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>I built this application for a client who had a portfolio of properties in many English cities. They had recently started acquiring new properties for the holiday rental market on sites such as airbnb.com and booking.com, as there was a higher profit margin than with traditional rentals. What they needed, was a tool that could easily deliver data based on certain criteria, so they could invest where there was the most value in the market. </p>

						</div>
						<p>The data is then saved in an easy to use format, leaving it simple to analyse later with Tableau, Power BI, Excel, etc.</p><br>
						<h3>Example</h3>
						<p>As an example, I've serched for properties in Brighton, East Sussex that have minimum 1 bedrooms and a maximum of Â£600k.</p>
						<div class="image-port" style='margin: auto; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 40px; max-width: 90%;'>
							<img src="images/powershell_snap.jpg" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
						</div>
						<p>As you can see from the image above, the tool has scanned 17 webpages and stored the results. This gave us a total of 419 rows of data, sorted by price, in a little under 20 seconds. The image below shows a snapshot of the data.</p>
