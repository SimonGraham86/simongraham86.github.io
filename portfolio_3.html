							<h2>Task Organiser</h2>
							<p>This app was created to help manage individual tasks that people have to complete on a daily basis.<br>
							It allows the user to enter new and manage existing tasks; view separate lists of tasks that are due, overdue and recently completed; and view a dashboard of interactive graphs, making it easier to manage their daily tasks.<br><br>
							This app was built in a Flask framework, and is connected to a simple postgres database using SQLAlchemy. The tables and graphs were created using pandas and bokeh. HTML and CSS were used to create the front end of the application. <br><br>
							See the gif below for more details.</p>

							<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>A friend of mine, who works as a freelance graphic designer, approached me because they were having difficulties dealing with the number of tasks they had to complete on any given day. They wanted a tool that would help them  keep track of these tasks, and organise their time better. One of the main things that they wanted were some visualisations that indicated how many tasks were due, completed, and most importantly, those that were overdue.</p>
							<div class="image-port" style='margin: auto; padding-top: 0px; padding-bottom: 40px; max-width: 90%;'>
								<img src="images/task_app.gif" alt="" style="max-width: 100%;"/>
							</div>
							<p>After completion of the tool, I began using it myself and having the real-time visualisations really helped with the prioritisation of my tasks. </p>
